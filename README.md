<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This small tool was created as a result of [this discussion on bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5437062.0).

The "Solomining Probability Calculator" is a tool designed to assist solo miners in understanding their chances of successfully mining a block on the Bitcoin network. The program takes the user's hash rate as input, supporting various formats for ease of use. It also retrieves the current Bitcoin network difficulty which is then used to calculate a range of important mining metrics. These include the ratio of all hashes over the valid hashes, the probability of each single hash attempt, expected time to mine a block and the probability of successfully mining a block for various time frames. Additionally, the program offers helpful analogy and phrases to provide a better human-understanding of the probabilities, making it easier for users to interpret the results. With this tool, solo miners can gain valuable insights into their mining operations and make more informed decisions. Overall, the solomining probability calculator is a valuable tool for any solo miner looking to increase their chances of success in the competitive world of cryptocurrency mining.

If you found this project useful and helpful, please consider making a donation to my bitcoin address bc1qycq57rtc2rjgslqk8kehjequ9z5egane**thanks** to support its continued development and maintenance. Your support is greatly appreciated and will go a long way in ensuring that this project continues to be a valuable resource for others. Thank you for your generosity!

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Note: Python2 is not supported.

* Python3 libs
```requests, re```

### Installation

1. Ensure you are running Python3
   ```sh
   python3 -V
   ```

2. Clone this repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/citb0in/solomining_probability_calc.git
   ```
   
3. Either make the python program executable
   ```sh
   chmod +x ./solomining_probability_calc.py
   ```
   and run it by
   ```sh
   ./solomining_probability_calc.py
   ```
   
   or just execute it by
   ```sh
   python3 solomining_probability_calc.py
   ```

## Usage

The program is started without parameters, after which the user is prompted to enter the solomining hashrate. Various formats are supported, the input is case-insensitive. The input requires an integer or floating number. You can provide one of the following available letters representing the corresponding units: (K)ilo, (M)ega, (G)iga, (T)era, (P)eta, (E)xa, (Z)etta, (Y)otta. You can add the letter 'h' or 'H' for hashes, you can add the slash character '/' and you can add the the letter 's' or 'S' or 'sec' or 'sEc' for seconds. You can use whitespaces and any combinations of those. If the unit is omitted then the input is evaluated as hashes/sec. After program start, both the hash rate entered by the user and the hash rate evaluated by the program are displayed for checking.

Examples:

Value followed by the unit as a single letter
  ```sh
  350g
  ```
  
Value followed by the unit as a single uppercase letter
  ```sh
  73M
  ```

Value followed by a space followed by the unit as a single uppercase letter
  ```sh
  10 T
  ```

Value followed by the lowercase unit-hashes abbreviation
  ```sh
  50ph
  ```

Float value followed by the unit-hashes-second abbreviation
  ```sh
  5.78phs
  ```

Float value followed by the unit-hashes per second abbreviation
  ```sh
  12.77Eh/s
  ```

Whitespace followed by a number followed by an uppercase unit letter followed by the uppercase S
  ```sh
   2.558 p H S
  ```

Or some weird input styles
  ```sh
         1234.56     T   h          /   sec
	    1234.56 p     / s  
  ```

... you get the idea, right?
